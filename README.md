# ü§ñ AI Job Coach

## Overview

The AI Job Coach is a sophisticated, end-to-end Streamlit application designed to streamline and enhance the job application process. It leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide a suite of tools for job seekers, from initial analysis to the generation of highly personalized and professionally formatted application documents.

This tool transforms the tedious process of tailoring a resume for each job application into a strategic, data-driven, and efficient workflow.

## ‚ú® Key Features

    *   **One-Time Setup**: On first launch, the application prompts you to upload your baseline JSON resume and a signature graphic.
    *   **Automatic Asset Loading**: These assets are saved locally, and on subsequent launches, the app loads them automatically, taking you directly to the main workflow.

2.  **Intelligent Job Description Parsing**:
